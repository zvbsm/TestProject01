# TestProject01

This project is a test of my coding abilities with AngularJS designing an app within 48 hours.

"Write an single page app in angular that takes in user input and generates a map with only the ratings on the map. You may use the Yelp API to get the rating data via JSON using HTTP get, and use google or leaflet to generate a map."
